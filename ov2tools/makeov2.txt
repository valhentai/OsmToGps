MAKEOV2 / DUMPOV2
=================

We provide a set of simple tools to generate POI databases. 
These tools are delivered "as is", free of charge. 

You can download the latest version here:
	http://www.palmtop.nl/ce/support/nav_poi.html


The first tool, MAKEOV2, can be used to convert a simple text file 
containing the coordinates and names of locations into a ready-to-
use OV2 file.

The second tool, DUMPOV2, can dump the content of POI databases into 
text format (yes, text that can be used by the MAKEOV2 tool). 




DUMPOV2 1.22
============

The use of DUMPOV2.EXE is simple and straightforward:

    DUMPOV2 [inputfilename] [outputfilename] 

The easiest usage is to provide no parameters: DUMPOV2 will convert
all OV2 and OVR files in the current directory.

If you specify "inputfilename", it must be a valid TomTom Navigator 
POI file (with extension OV2) or a valid Route Planner or Citymaps 
OVERLAY file (with extension OVR). It is recommended to provide
an outputfilename with extension ASC. 




MAKEOV2 1.1
===========

The use of MAKEOV2.EXE is as follows:

    MAKEOV2 inputfilename [outputfilename] 

The input file should be a text file (extension ASC is recommended!) that 
should simply contain lines of text. Any line starting with a semi-colon 
will be ignored. Empty lines will also be ignored. All other lines are 
expected to represent points of interest. Such a line should specify a 
longitude, a latitude and a name, seperated by commas. 

It is recommended that the name is put between double quotes. 

A name should not contain double quotes. Longitudes and latitudes may be 
specified either as degrees and fractions of degrees, or in degrees, 
minutes and seconds. Both colons and single-quote/double-quote notation 
may be used for minutes and seconds. So, all the following lines are 
all equivalent: 


	53.5 , 4 , "Truckers Restaurant La Bamba" 
	53.5000000 , 4.00000000 , "Truckers Restaurant La Bamba"
	53'30"00 , 4'00"00 , "Truckers Restaurant La Bamba" 
	53'30 , 4'0 , "Truckers Restaurant La Bamba" 
	53:30:0 , 4 , "Truckers Restaurant La Bamba"
